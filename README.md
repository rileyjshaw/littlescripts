#littlescripts
A bunch of unrelated scripts that are too tiny to merit their own repository.

##applescript
#better_volume_down
Some moron at Apple decided that pressing the volume down key on a Mac should unmute it. This script makes it a little better by immediately re-muting your Mac.

##batch
#printer_reset.bat
Ah, Windows printers. This script clears and resets your spooler, which kicks the ass of any jobs stuck in the queue. Voted as Mom's Favorite, 2008.

##javascript
#wrap_selects
Places <select> elements on the page into wrappers, which is a good first step for styling them. I can't *wait* until we can do away with this once & for all, but for now it's still a necessary evil.

##python
#random_english_word
Prints out 8 random English words from an array. Comments indicate how the array was obtained.
